              <p>So I was born in <strong>Vigo, Pontevedra.</strong> Then, I moved to MÃ¡laga, where I got my <strong>science's certification of secondary education. </strong>  By that time, I started to really like technology and wondering if I could study something related with it.</p>

            <div class="subtext" id="main">
              <p>And that's what I did. I moved to <strong>Madrid</strong> so I could study <strong>Software Engineer</strong> in the university Rey Juan Carlos.</p>
              <p>After four years, I got my degree and started to introducing me in the professional field! I had the opportunity to work with <strong>BHDynamics</strong>, which was brilliant; they had a loooooot of experience and I know that I learned so much with them <i>(including hardware things that I never did in my degree)</i> so I'm very grateful for that.</p>

              <p>Then, I started working with <strong>SIA</strong><i> an Indra company</i> and that's where I am working right now, with a team in the cibersecurity department for BBVA.</p>
